# Camile's Scheduler App

## Description

This simple calendar application allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by the Day.js jQuery API.

## User Story

AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule:
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar 

WHEN I scroll down
WHEN I view the timeblocks 
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event

WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

The animation below demonstrates the application functionality:
